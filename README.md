Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the collection and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent

### Making Modifications to This Script
Please put the script in the same directory where the data has been downloaded and extracted.

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
